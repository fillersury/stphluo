# stphluo

This is a modern, responsive portfolio site built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to showcase Stephanie Luo’s UI/UX design work. The site emphasizes clean aesthetics, intuitive layout, and seamless responsiveness across devices. Every component is hand-crafted to reflect a high standard of front-end engineering, highlighting my ability to build elegant, performant user interfaces with a focus on scalability and maintainability.

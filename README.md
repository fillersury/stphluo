# stphluo

A sleek, responsive personal portfolio site built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This site showcases my full-stack engineering work (`Compiled`), creative coding and design projects (`Created`), and original photography (`Captured`). It features dark/light mode, smooth page transitions, and a mobile-optimized slide-out navigation menu.
